# Binarized ResNet: Enabling Automatic ModulationClassification at the resource-constrained Edge
This repository is a research oriented-repository dedicated to the Binarized ResNet: Enabling Automatic ModulationClassification at the resource-constrained Edge. 

The main idea is to release the code of our papers in a very friendly manner such that it cultivates and accelerates further research on this topic. The codes are released in a series of Jupyter notebooks, which are developed with a how to do it in a step-by-step approach. We also provide a research library dedicated to the latest works on this topic.

If you have any comments, please contact 

I hope you enjoy it and good luck with your research.

- **About the work:** This work is based on Deep Learning methods used for Automatic Modulation Classification at the Edge with constrained resources. Firstly we propose a new architecture for AMC and then we binarize and rotate the weights and activations to bring down the memory and comutational complexity to the minimal. Next we improve the accuracy by ensembling those architectures.
